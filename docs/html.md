# HTML

Static HTML is generated from JSX templates using Preact (https://preactjs.com/).

The Preact component lifecycle runs once to generate an HTML string. If you want to use Preact on the client-side you ca;n create a JavaScript module or microfrontend that returns a component in the `src/js/modules/` directory.

<!-- 
To do:

- add microfrontend example in JS folder
